          <p>Spacey is accused of indecent assault and battery for allegedly groping an 18-year-old busboy
        in July 2016 at the Club Car restaurant and bar on the island of Nantucket. He has pleaded not guilty.
       <p>A newly released March filing by Spacey's attorney includes screenshots of texts exchanged between Spacey's
        accuser and his girlfriend on the night of the alleged encounter.
       <br><br>CNN is not naming Spacey's accuser because he is an alleged sexual assault victim.
